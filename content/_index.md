## this is my blog

This is a place where I write about stuff I find interesting that I want to tell
other people about.

This is also a place where I can put stuff I'll forget in a month that I need to
know.

I like to a wide variety of topics from embedded projects to distributed systems

You can learn more about me on my website: [ibj.io](https://ibj.io)
